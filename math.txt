A truck sprang a leak at the bottom of its radiator, which held 480 ounces of fluid when it started to leak, and started losing radiator fluid at a constant rate of 4 ounces per minute. Suppose that the radiator continued to leak at this constant rate and that the truck, traveling at 35 miles per hour, could continue traveling at this rate until its radiator was completely empty. In how many miles would the radiator be empty?
*) 13.7 *) 17.5 *) 35.0 *) 70.0 *) 120.0
        70.0
